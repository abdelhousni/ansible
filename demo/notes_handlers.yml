handlers:
  definition: a dormant task, that executes when a notifying task results in a changed state

  why handlers: there may be a need to execute a task only when required

  execution order:
    - handlers execute after the tasks for a play
    - by default, if an error exists in a play, the play will abort and any notified handlers will not execute
    - while the same handler may be notified by several other tasks, it will only execute once

order of execution for a playbook:
  - pre_tasks
  - handlers for pre_tasks
  - roles
  - tasks
  - handlers for roles and tasks
  - post_tasks
  - handlers for post_tasks
